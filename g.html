               <h6>Capture A Memory That Will Last Forever:
              </h6>
               <p>A photo can capture a moment, and it’ll last forever. You’re the one that captures that moment! I think a lot of people take this idea for granted being that photography is so accessible these days.</p>

              <h6>Clients Will Buy Into Your Vision:</h6>
              <p>Your clients will be more than happy to let you express your individuality. The reason why they chose you over your competition is because they share your sense of style and vision. Don’t change who you are and be true to yourself. Which leads me to my next point.</p>

              <h6>Create Your Portfolio</h6>
              <p> This is where you get to show off who you are and what your style is. Don’t rush and do a half-ass job. Create a portfolio that stands out from the rest, while keeping true to your style and who you are. You’re in control of how others perceive your artistry.</p>

              <h6>You Get To Tell A Story</h6>
              <p>A photographer gets to tell a story through images. Those images are the documentation of important moments in someones life, or an adventure you’ve been on. It’s with these images people get to relive the moments that truly matter.

            <h6>Every Day Is Different:</h6>
            <p>No two days are alike in photography. One day you’ll be out drinking champagne with the bride and groom and the next day you’ll be editing. Even if you have two weddings in one weekend, those two events won’t be the same. You get to be at different places, see different faces and experience something different each and every time.</p>
